# Chrome searchBar Suggestions auto-encoder-NLP Project

<p>
whenever users will search anything in the chrome search bar at that it gives their    suggestions
for the users. So how it is gives the suggestions to the users, this is the problem statement of this project.
and i will solve this problem statement in this project by building own NLP
model and Training Pipeline to give the suggestions to the users.
</p>

### Build a Robust Training pipeline for this project.
i Build a Robust Training Pipeline by the python Oop concepts, because in future, if i will may have good amount of chrome user histories. then i can easily again execute my Training Pipeline with new history data.
and according to the Dataset i has managed my Training Pipeline components.
and in the modelEvaluation my code will compare accuracy to the previous model. if my current model will be better to the previous model. then my current model will go to the production.

### Training Pipelines components.
<ul>
<li>Data ingestion.</li>
<li>Data validation.</li>
<li>Data cleaning.</li>
<li>Data Transformation.</li>
<li>ModelTrainer.</li>
<li>ModelEvaluation. </li>
<li>ModelPusher.</li>
</ul>

### To complete this project, i arranged chrome History from multiple chrome users.
<p><b>i arranged the chrome history from multiple of my collegeus and friends, because i wants to complete this project on the realworld dataset. when i was got the histories of the chrome users, there are very messy data was available, i did lot of text preprocessing on the chrome user histories. then i performed NLP operation on my dataset. </b></p>

<p><b>Code written in Modular fashion, i used Object oriented programing concepts<br>
of python, and followed the industry standard of project.</b></p>
